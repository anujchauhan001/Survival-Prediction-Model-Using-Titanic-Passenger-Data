Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model uses the famous Titanic dataset, which provides information on the passengers aboard the ship, including their demographics, ticket information, and survival status.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a given passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic using supervised learning techniques. This problem is framed as a binary classification problem where the target variable is the survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle. 
Key Features
PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

Model Training and Evaluation
The Jupyter Notebook (titanic_model.ipynb) contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Key steps include:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (e.g., imputing missing ages).
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., converting Sex and Embarked to numeric values).
Feature scaling and selection.
